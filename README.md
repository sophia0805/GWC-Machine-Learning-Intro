# GWC Machine Learning Introduction | [![Athena Award Badge](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https%3A%2F%2Faward.athena.hackclub.com%2Fapi%2Fbadge)](https://award.athena.hackclub.com?utm_source=readme)

> a machine learning project analyzing heart disease indicators using decision trees to predict heart disease based on various health factors

## features

- loads and processes heart disease dataset from 2020
- data cleaning with label encoding and one-hot encoding
- trains decision tree classifier model
- evaluates model accuracy with testing and training datasets
- displays confusion matrix for model performance
- prints interpretable decision tree structure
- interactive prompts to guide through analysis

## usage

1. the program will load the heart disease dataset and show a sample
2. it will clean the data using label encoding and one-hot encoding
3. a decision tree model will be trained on the training dataset
4. follow the on-screen prompts to view model accuracy and confusion matrix
5. view the text representation of how the decision tree makes predictions

## installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sophia0805/GWC-Machine-Learning
   cd GWC-Machine-Learning
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install pandas scikit-learn
   ```

3. **Download the dataset**
   - Ensure `heartDisease_2020_sampling.csv` is in the same directory as the script
   - The dataset should be available or downloaded separately

4. **Download GWC utilities module**
   - Ensure `GWCutilities.py` is in the same directory as the script

5. **Run the program**
   ```bash
   python "Machine Learning Introduction.py"
   ```

## history
this is my second machine learning project through girls who code! i learned about decision trees and how to evaluate model performance with accuracy scores and confusion matrices
